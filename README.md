# Legendre's Conjecture Checker

## Overview

This Python program, named "legendre_conjecture_checker.py," is designed to check Legendre's Conjecture for a given positive integer n. Legendre's Conjecture posits that there is always a prime number between n^2 and (n+1)^2 for any positive integer n.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
   
   ```bash
   python legendre_conjecture_checker.py
   ```

2. **Enter a Positive Integer:**
   
   When prompted, enter a positive integer n.

3. **View the Result:**

   The program will output whether Legendre's Conjecture holds true for the given value of n.

## Example

```bash
python legendre_conjecture_checker.py
```

```plaintext
Enter a positive integer (n): 5
Legendre's Conjecture holds true for n = 5.
```

## Note

This program is a simple demonstration and may not be optimized for extremely large values of n. It serves as a basic tool to explore Legendre's Conjecture for smaller positive integers.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or explore the code.
